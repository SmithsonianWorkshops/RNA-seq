# RNAseq

These are the materials used for the RNAseq workshop given at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History on February 8th 2017.

**Note: This tutorial has been updated and modified from the Trinity tutorial given by Brian Haas [here](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/KrumlovTrinityWorkshopJan2016/wiki/Home/e67c7a4ae4fe005866a56371ea29f15c79e8ccfb) for use on the Smithsonian HPC. We will also use data from [Defining the transcriptomic landscape of Candida glabrata by RNA-Seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25586221). We are very grateful that these materials have been made public by the Trinity team!**
